# Laboratory Work : Unique Integer Array from Rounded Real Numbers

## Objective
The purpose of this program is to:
- Read an array of real numbers (up to 45 elements) from the keyboard.
- Round each element to the nearest integer.
- Store these rounded values in a new array, ensuring no duplicate values are included.
- Print the resulting array.

## Requirements
- The program must handle up to 45 elements in the input array.
- The output array should contain only unique integers.

## Description

### Input
1. The user is prompted to enter the number of elements in the array (with a maximum of 45).
2. The user then inputs the elements of the array, which are real numbers.

### Processing
- The program rounds each element of the input array to the nearest integer using the `round()` function.
- Each rounded value is checked for duplicates before being added to the new integer array.
- Only unique integers are added to the new array.

### Output
- The program prints the final array of unique integers.
