"Guess the Number" Game
This code implements a simple console-based number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it within 10 attempts.

Main Functions:
random(int start, int stop):

Generates a random number within the specified range from start to stop.
read_int(int value, int attempt):

Takes the generated random number and the number of attempts.
For each attempt, the player inputs a number, and the program indicates whether the guess is lower or higher than the random number.
main():

The main function initializes the game, sets the number of attempts, and defines the minimum and maximum values for the random number.
After the game concludes, it displays a message indicating whether the player won or lost.
Key Features:
The player has 10 attempts to guess a random number between 1 and 100.
If the player guesses the number within the given attempts, they win; otherwise, the game ends in a loss.
